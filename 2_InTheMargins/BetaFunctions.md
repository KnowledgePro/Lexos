# Beta Functions

In case we need to create an _In the Margins_ page on beta functions, they can be documented here.

## Web Scraper
Enabling beta functions will show a link to the web scraper tool on the Upload screen. The web scraper accepts a list of urls instead of an upload file list, and downloads documents off the internet, inserting them into the session folder. From there, they may be manipulated just as uploaded files are. Note that texts such as those from Project Gutenberg should be scraped using the url to their plain text format. Lexos can scrape web pages, but they will contain all their original HTML, which must then be scrubbed.

Warnings: Web Scraper does not have extensive sanitation functions, so only scrape from a trusted source. Also Web Scraper has not been tested on large data sets. Lexos should not be used for large-scale or "big data" web scraping.
