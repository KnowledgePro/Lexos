3. __Example:__  
   
4. __Issue/Questions:__  
   This doesn't always look like it has the number of words selected, especially with the default. I think there might be a cap on the number of words they can fit in the Word Cloud and the words selected may be any of the most frequent words up to the number of words you selected.

### View Word Counts
1. __Tool Tip:__  
   none
2. __Tool Tip Extended:__  
   Selecting this tool will give you a pop-up with all of the terms in your selected documents and the number of times those terms appear.
3. __Example:__  
   
4. __Issue/Questions:__  
The d3.js algorithm used to create word clouds drops high frequency words if they cannot fit within the layout. Users are advised to check the table of term counts to make sure that the highest ranked words are in the clouds produced by Lexos. Sometimes re-generating the clouds with different settings will cause the terms to appear in the new layout.
