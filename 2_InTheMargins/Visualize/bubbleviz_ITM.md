BubbleViz offers an alternative to word clouds as a method of visualizing the **Document-Term Matrix**. They present terms arranged inside circles ("bubbles") sized according to the terms' frequency within the text. BubbleViz graphs enable you to get a sense of the content in your corpus, and they are very good for presentations. To generate a BubbleViz, select some or all of your active documents using the **Select Document(s)** check boxes. The Lexos **BubbleViz** tool allows you to control the **Graph Size** (in pixels) and to filter the **Maximum Number of Terms**. You can also set a **Minimum Term Length**: the minimum number of characters required in a term for it to be added to the graph. Once you have chosen your options, click the **Get Graph** button to generate the graph. If you then wish to download the graph as a PNG file, click the **Save as PNG** button.

Run your mouse cursor over the bubble to open a tooltip showing the number of times the term occurs in you selected document(s).
