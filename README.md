# Lexos
# Summary
Lexos is an integrated workflow of tools to facilitate the
computational analyses of texts. Functionality provided includes
the ability to "scrub" texts (remove punctuation, lemmatize,
consolidate characters, remove stopwords, etc), cut or segment texts,
and a suite of options for analysis, including
creating and downloading matrices (.csv) of word counts, and
making dendrograms (cluster analysis), bubble visualizations, and
word clouds. More functionality is being added on an ongoing basis.

## System Architecture (in brief)
Lexos is written primarily in Python 2.7.3 using the Flask microframework,
based on Werkzeug and Jinja 2. A heavy dose of Javascript and CSS
is included. The INSTALLME file provides directions for setting up the
development environment for testing using localhost:5000 in your local browser.

## Contributors
Richard Neal is our software lead. Significant contributions were made by
Bryan Jensen, Scott Kleinman, Devin Delfino, Julia Morneau, Vicky Li,
and Mark LeBlanc. Previous iterations of our tools included contributions
by Alicia Herbert, Donald Bass, Doug Raffle, Christina Nelson, and Mike Kahn.
The majority of these developers are undergraduate students in the
Lexomics Research Group at Wheaton College (Norton, MA).
