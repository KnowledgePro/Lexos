Lexos
==========

# Summary
Lexos is an integrated workflow of tools to facilitate the
computational analyses of texts. Functionality provided includes
the ability to "scrub" texts (remove punctuation, lemmatize,
consolidate characters, remove stopwords, etc), cut or segment texts,
and a suite of options for analysis, including
creating and downloading matrices (.csv) of word counts, and
making dendrograms (cluster analysis), bubble visualizations, and
word clouds.
