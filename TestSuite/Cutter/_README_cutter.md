#Cutter
The cutter is a powerful tool to break up a text into different "chunks". 
A chunk is a segment of the original text as tokenized by a letter 
(character n-gram) or word (word n-gram) size that is
determined by the user's choices on the cutter page.

Lexos allows the user to choose between 4 different cutting operations:

(A) Characters/Segment - Characters per segment divides the corpus into segments with a specific
number of characters per segment.

(B) Words(Tokens)/Segment - Words(tokens) per segment divides a text into segments containing
a set number of words(tokens) in each of the segments.

(C) Lines/Segment - Lines per segment divides a text into segments with a specific
number of lines per segment.

(D) Segments/File - Segments per file divides the corpus into as many segments as the user
specifies.
