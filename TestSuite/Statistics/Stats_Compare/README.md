# STATS COMPARE

We want to check whether the counting on STATS page work for large files, thus we used other two tools to compare the result.

The other two are: 
- Voyant(search it and use it online;
- Intelligent Archive(need download to use, try on mac since it was written in JAVA, need whatever operating systems that supports java)

Need to know:
- Voyant does not do scrubbing stuff, it count the words as how it apperas in the original uploading files
- Intelligent Archive provides a space to let users edit the words to exclude from process after uploading files and click "Word Frequencies", only tried a few punctuations but not sure whether those are all or not


Test files:
- War and Peace(original one)
- War and Peace(removed punctuations using Lexos)
- War and Peace(removed punctuations and made all in lowercase using Lexos)
- War and Peace(removed punctuations and made all in lowercase and removed digits using Lexos)

The following test files are in Chinese and English folders separately: 

- DreamCH1(original one)
- DreamCH1(removed punctuations using Lexos)

- Heart_of_Darkness(original one)
- Heart_of_Darkness(removed punctuations using Lexos)

Go to "STATS_Compare.ods" for results.
