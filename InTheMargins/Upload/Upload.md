### File Upload Size and Supported Formats

1. __Tool Tip:__  
   Upload times may vary, depending on internet speeds. If the upload seems to hang, try uploading smaller files. If you are uploading many files, try uploading them in small batches.
2. __Tool Tip Extended:__  
   The maximum file size is set at 250MB due to an ajax restriction to prevent very slow upload speeds. 250MB however is approximately the size of nine Webster Unabridged Dictionaries, which should handle any of the files you'll use. This restriction also only applies to one file as you are able to upload multiple 250MB files at the same time.  
   The file formats we support are .txt, .xml, .html, and .sgml.

### Web Scrapper
1. __Tool Tip:__  
   Upload times may vary, depending on internet speeds. If the process seems to hang, try uploading fewer urls. Large-scale web scraping should not be done in Lexos.
