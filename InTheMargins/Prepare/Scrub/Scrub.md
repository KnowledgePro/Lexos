## <a name='features'></a> Scrubbing Options

### Project Gutenberg
1. __Tool Tip:__  
   none
2. __Tool Tip Extended:__  
   Upon entering the scrub page if you have uploaded a file from the Project Gutenberg website without removing the boiler plates (text added by the Project Gutenberg site) you will receive a warning. If you choose to continue without removing this extra text on your own the text that is a part of every Project Gutenberg file will be removed, but there are inconsistencies from file to file because of additional text added by the contributors. For this reason we suggest you edit the file yourself to prevent extra unwanted text from being included in your word counts and other tests as you continue working with Lexos.

## <a name='addition'></a> Additional Options

### Stop Words/Keep Words
1. __Tool Tip:__  
   * Input a list of Stop Words (words to be removed) or Keep Words (words to keep).  
   * List format: a list of words separated by commas.
2. __Tool Tip Extended:__  
   By default this tool is off, but has the functionality to either select specific words to keep (keep words) or to remove (stop words). Stop words will remove all instances of the tokens listed, but will not remove that word within another word. Keep words will remove all tokens except for instances of the words listed. Either a file can be uploaded with these tokens or they can be manually entered in the box separated by commas.
3. __Example:__  
   * Stop Words: your stop word is "cat", your text is "The cat catches the caterpillar on the catwalk.", the text after scrubbing is "The catches the caterpillar on the catwalk."  
   * Keep Words: your keep words are "ball, cat", your text is "The cat chased the ball across the street, but got distracted by the balloon.", the text after scrubbing is "cat ball"
   
4. __Issue/Questions:__  
   I don't believe this works with removed white space. Should this be mentioned and is it an issue?
   
### Lemmas
1. __Tool Tip:__  
   * Input a list of lemmas (word replacements).  
   * Lemma list format: one set of replacement words per line (each separated by commas) followed by a colon(:) then the lemma (e.g. *cyng,kyng:king* will replace every *cyng* and *kyng* in the document with *king*).
2. __Tool Tip Extended:__  
   Using this tool will replace a token or tokens with a different token (lemma). This can be used to replace words that have variations in spelling throughout the text with one spelling of the word.
3. __Example:__  
   Lemma: cyng,kyng:king  
   Text: The kyng ruled the cyngdom.  
   Scrubbed text: The king ruled the kingdom.  
4. __Issue/Questions:__  
   From what I can tell it replaces any instance whether it's part of another word or on its own, correct me if this is wrong.
   
### Consolidations
1. __Tool Tip:__  
   Input a list of consolidations (character replacements).  
   Consolidation list format: one set of replacement characters per line (each separated by commas) followed by a colon(:) then the replacement character (e.g. *a,b:c* will replace every *a* and *b* in the document with *c*).
2. __Tool Tip Extended:__  
   Selecting this tool allows you to replace any single character or characters with a different single character
3. __Example:__  
   Consolidation: a:o, Text: The cat sat on the rat., Scrubbed text: The cot sot on the rot.
4. __Issue/Questions:__  
   Like lemmas this is what it looks like to me, but not completely sure.
   
### Special Characters
1. __Tool Tip:__  
   * Input a list of rules for handling non-unicode characters (e.g. Ã¦).  
   * Special Character list format: one set of replacement words or characters per line (each separated by commas) followed by a colon(:) then the replacement word or character (e.g. *Ã¦,ae:Ã¦* will replace *Ã¦* and *ae* with *Ã¦*).
2. __Tool Tip Extended:__  
   
3. __Example:__  
   
4. __Issue/Questions:__  
   I don't know how to explain this better than it is in the tool tip.
