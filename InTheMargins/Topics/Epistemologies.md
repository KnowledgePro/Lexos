# Epistemologies

This is just an idea for a topics page. Recently, there is has been some noise about _transformative_ modes of interpretation. Essentially, they relate to how we gain knowledge from they types of patterns we observe in computational text analysis. The concept overlaps but is sometimes distinguished from Stephen Ramsay's "algorithmic criticism" and McGann and Samuel's "deformative criticism". Here are two recent contributions from slightly different perspectives:
