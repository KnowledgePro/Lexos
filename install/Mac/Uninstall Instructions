(Uninstaller script to be written in the near future)
To manually uninstall Lexos:
    1) Navigate to your home directory in the finder
    2) Locate the "Lexos-master" folder
    3) To uninstall Lexos, simply delete this folder
    5) To reinstall Lexos, run the Mac_Updater.command file in the Mac Installer Bundle
    4) Optional: To uninstall Anaconda (the platform Lexos runs on) delete the "Anaconda2" folder which is also in the home directory (Warning, to reinstall after this operation requires running the installer.command again from scratch)
